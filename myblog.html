        <h1 class="w">Ubud, Bali, Indonesia</h1>
        <p>Ubud - famous for being the setting of the ‘love’ segment of the best-selling memoir, Eat Pray Love, Ubud is
            often referred to as the ‘Cultural Heart of Bali’. For some Ubud acts as a place of spiritual awakening,
            for some it is a get away from the charged atmosphere of South Bali and for others it is the one place in
            the world that convinced them to turn away from their western lifestyles and turn a stay of a couple of
            days into months or years.
        </p>
        <img src="blog/p39.jpg" alt="rice feilds" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>The green terraced hills of Ubud are a cocktail of traditional Balinese Culture, yoga, elaborate vegan
            delicacies, beautiful temples infused with royalty. We enjoyed the food, the cultural shows, the temples
            and more importantly the hospitality offered by the locals. In contrast to South Bali which is hosted by
            slightly aggressive, Ubud, is home to Balinese people who are some of the friendliest individuals you would
            meet around the region.
        </p>
        <p>While travelling through Bali, Ubud is the ideal base to explore central, northern and eastern parts of
            Bali. It allows for you to get away from the touristy vibe and experience Bali for what it traditionally
            represents.

        <p><b>Food specialities: </b> Vegan delicacies, detox drinks, cheap cocktails</p>
        <p><b>Attractions: </b> Monkey Forest Sanctuary, Tegallalang rice fields, Yoga centers, massage spas, art
            markets, cultural shows
        </p>
        <p><b>Tips: </b>Always bargain – don’t let the over friendliness fool you (start 20-25% of the proposed price),
            talk to locals and hire a car + driver for the whole day, the food is worth the money

        <h1 class="w">Melbourne, Australia</h1>
        <p>For years Melbourne has been the holder the title of “The Worlds Most Livable City” and why would it not be
            with its multicultural population and various ethnic enclaves which help create an accepting environment.
            Out of the major Australian cities I have visited I felt Melbourne was the city that reminded me of
            Wellington the most. What surprised me were the facts I learnt on the free CBD tram that Melbourne has the
            largest Italian population outside of Italy, is home to the third largest Greek speaking city based
            population globally and the large Vietnamese influx was reflected by Nyugen being the second most common
            surname in Melbourne’s phone book. The cultural diversity spills over in the quality diverse restaurants
            which are dispersed between the hipster cafes which are home for the world-famous Melbourne coffee.
        </p>
        <img src="blog/mel1.jpeg" alt="Melbourne" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>Over the course of three days we focused on getting to experience Melbourne like a local as much as
            possible. The frequency of public transport helped us to travel to the nearby suburbs of St. Kilda and
            Brighton to get away from the bustling CBD region and enjoy the beaches and its attractions. Having a
            passion in architecture meant I could marvel at the infrastructure and layout of the city which meant we
            could walk along the beautiful Yarra River, past the Flinders station on the way to the historical MCG to
            watch Melbourne Football Club take apart the opposition in a game of Aussie Rules. As all cities have their
            strengths and weaknesses, the three days helped me conclude why year in year out Melbourne is awarded the
            title of “The World’s Most Livable City”.

        <p><b>Food specialities: </b> world famous Coffee, multi-cultural cuisine and rooftop bar hopping</p>
        <p><b>Attractions: </b> Catch a sports game at the MCG, walk around the CBD and don’t miss the alleyways
            littered with street art, walk along the Yarra river and take in Melbourne come to life at night and watch
            the sunset over Melbourne from St. Kilda after marveling the Brighton Bathing boxes.
        </p>
        <p><b>Tips: </b>Catch Skybus from and to Airport, the expensive eateries aren’t always the best, walk or catch
            the tram around the CBD

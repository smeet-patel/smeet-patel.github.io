        <h2>Project Summary </h2>
        <p>This project is an application development for a (fictitious) burger restaurant in Wellington which aims to
            allow customers to create a custom burger in a user-friendly manner. We have implemented a database to
            store the orders, burger ingredients, and a list of customers connected with the production line
            application using Java which the staff at Dimmu Burger will use. The completion of this project would
            benefit Dimmu Burger and its
            users because of a user-friendly interface that allows customers to order burgers.
            <!-- and hence improve the number of customer orders and customer experience. -->

        <h2>Plan Design and Initial Reseach Process </h2>
        <p>Our first step was to individually research on exisitng burger ordering system and make a note of
            the feature which we thought were important. Following this, we then came back together to share our ideas
            and thoughts. This led to drafting an outline of the general structure of the applications. </p>

        <h2>Application Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I often use wireframes for projects which have user interfaces as it helps me stay focused when developing
            the application or prototype because they are simple outlines of the UI layout. Many of the elements are
            placeholders, so this allows me to determine if I need to acquire or create content, develop the visuals
            and functionality. </p>

        <p>My previous experience in web development meant that I was responsible for producing the web application. I

            PHP function with the databases. </p>

        <h2>Second Week (Monday)</h2>

        <p>I redesigned the ordering form usability for both touch and computer devices by making both radio buttons
            and checkboxes larger and changing the input number spinner to a slider which a fixed range. After changing
            the UI, my task was to develop the javascript to add the price and to display the quality of ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Second Week (Tuesday and Wednesday)</h2>
        <p>For the second day of the week, my task was to finish the javascript and to debug issues with the javascript
            and to move onto PHP. </p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Kelly and I worked on transferring web app to Heroku to PDO format and implemented the Ajax
            live status update for the order. Before everyone arrived on the day, I also got the website landing page
            done with a customised banner and button which lead to the ordering web-page.</p>

        <p>On the last day, we all prepared for the live demonstration, and by using the application more and more to
            integrate the kitchen production line Java application and the order web app to Heroku, we found more bugs
            to fix.</p>

        <h2>Integration </h2>
        <h3 style="color: orange">Heroku </h3>
        <p>Heroku is a cloud platform for hosting web applications and databases. We chose to use Heroku because we
            thought that it would be a good way for everyone to access everything from anywhere. We looked into a few
            other hosting options at the time such as Google FireBase, with which you can also host web applications
            for free, but ultimately chose to use Heroku because we also wanted to use a SQL database with a schema.</p>
        <p>To get started with Heroku we followed the documentation explaining how to host a PHP project with Heroku
            and provision a Heroku PostGreSQL database to it. It went through installing PHP and a dependency manager
            for PHP called Composer which allows you to declare PHP libraries you will be using in your project.</p>
        <h3 style="color: orange">PHP + PDO </h3>
        <p>In our Heroku web app, we used PDO or PHP Data Objects rather than SQLi to make calls and connect to the
            database. This came as we soon realised that we were developing with both a MariaDB database and a PostGres
            Database. Looking at our options, we could have either changed it to PostGres or PDO - which has the
            benefit of having drivers available for many different SQL databases and also seemed to be better regarding
            security and the risk of SQL injection as PDO uses prepared statements when connecting to the database.
            Overall, though we would need more time to look into different security risks to say that our website is
            truly secure.</p>
        <h3 style="color: orange">AJAX</h3>
        <p>One challenging thing that we wanted to do was to display when the status of a burger changes from ‘new’ to
            ‘received’ to ‘in progress’ to ‘complete’ as it was updated by the kitchen staff in the Production Line
            app. Originally we had the idea that we might be able to ask the database if there had been any changes to
            the database in a timed interval, say every 3 seconds. AJAX, which is a set of techniques in Javascript
            uses HTTP request and allows the web page to be asynchronously updated. To get this set up, we mostly
            <span id="reflection"></span>
            followed this guide https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp as AJAX has a set way of doing things such
            as check the status is 200 (everything O.K.) </p>
        <h1 class="w">Reflection</h1>
        <h3 style="color: orange">What We Changed From Our Original Plan </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ordering multiple burgers within a single order.
                <ul>
                    <li>We initially planned for an order to be able to contain multiple different burgers within it.
                        However, as
                        we approached the end of the project and this feature had not been implemented, a decision was
                        made to
                        leave this option out.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The customer gets an estimated time until order ready.<ul>
                    <li>Once the customer had placed an order, there was going to be a feature on the final page (that
                        displayed their order number and order state) that gave an estimated time until their order was
                        complete. This
                        would have been based on how many burgers were in the queue in front of theirs. This feature
                        was not
                        implemented due to time constraints.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Customer orders not pulling stock levels from the kitchen (can order out of stock ingredients)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The web application was meant to make a stock level request from the database before it loaded
                    the webpage, and only display the ingredients that were currently in stock. This would be to
                    prevent from ordering ingredients that were currently unavailable. Unfortunately, the team lost
                    sight of this requirement while working on the application, and when we realised it was missing, we
                    did not have enough time left to implement it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Originally, the webpage also talked to jdbc class</li>
            <ul>
                <li>When we initially designed the application structure, it was envisioned that the webpage would also
                    be talking to the jdbc class, and the jdbc class would be the only class talking to the database.
                    As
                    the project progressed, we realised that our web application worked better if it was talking
                    directly
                    to the database. This still left the database as the only link between the front- and back-end
                    applications, which was desired.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: orange">Conclusion </h3>
        <p>Overall, we were happy with the final outcome of our project and feel that we successfully managed to
            incorporate the
            main functionality for the two applications while having a strong emphasis for user experience for the web
            app. </p>
        <p>Our team functioned and collaborated very well as a group, providing support and assistance to each other
            when needed. We all felt very motivated to achieve a great end result, which we believe is clear in the way
            everybody got involved and took responsibility for their part of the project as we got all the pieces
            together. We might have underestimated our time frame for some of the feature. As a result, we had some
            uncomplete task which can be justified for thinking outside of the box and researching new technologies
            which were not introduced in our program and implementing using Heroku. Also, this was not an actual
            requirement, but we decided that we also had to develop a mobile-first approach and responsive web design
            for all devices and made the build based on the usability heuristic. If I was to do a similar project
            again, I would like to like to Explore Google Firebase to store the inventory information and sales
            records.</p>

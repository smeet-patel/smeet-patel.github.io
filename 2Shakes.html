        <h1 class="w">2Shakes CX Redesign</h1>
        <p>This project aimed to improve the profile setup step of 2Shakes web application. The 2Shakes software is
            centralised around the idea of automating the currently paper-based processes that many bookkeepers and
            accountants undergo. By improving the profile set up phase of the system accomplishes an efficient,
            user-friendly profile setup process as well as a visually appealing UX allowing for an intuitive process.
            By achieving these goals, 2Shakes will be able to overcome the barriers, such as converting customers on
            trial to paying customers.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, it will reduce the number of clients and potential clients asking for support services when
            setting up a profile. It will also mean clients are more inclined to convert into paying customers as they
            find the setting up process to be clean and easy. We will be achieving these goals on behalf of 2Shakes
            (Mike Kelly and Ata McGregor).</p>

        <br>
        <h2 class="w2">Initial Wireframes</h2>
        <p>As a group, we chose to design our own wireframes because this allowed us to represent more concepts to
            2Shakes at the meeting and we each had slightly different taste to design, so it was great we see everyones
            perspective and implementation. </p>
        <img src="2shakes/inital wireframe overview.PNG" alt="Wireframes overview" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>Above is an overview of the wireframe design by each member of the team starting off with Caradine's
            wireframe top left, followed by Vrutika's and Caradine's bottom left and mine (Smeet)</p>
        <h3>My Initial Wireframes</h3>
        <div class="video-container" style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTvkE3JU8D1hKYvkH0tyvVfmUHwtwl0qaynVkTUmKDiTFf4fUKQqoPsrC_aSRvwzQDtKnkrT8MTUMfb/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000"

        <h3>Week 4 Wireframes Feedback</h3>
        <p>In our meeting with 2Shakes, we had each received some feedback. We were told that overall all of the
            wireframe had some good aspects/features in our individual designs that we could implement and combine into
            a single group wireframe.</p>
        <h3>Revised Group Wireframe and Sponsor Feedback</h3>
        <div class="iframe-container">
            <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQBHoMG8VB851R4EBHb8DlTsi7ZGYo8Ww0wkZeTlj8dWmRMi6EfYna9CpHEBA-MBkmVgpoEbs2FMb_i/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=2000"

                webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>For our next meet with the project sponsor (Week 6, we got feedback on the latest wireframe which was based on
            Priya's initial wireframe. During the meeting, we annotated the wireframe design as shown in the slides
            above. Based on Priya's wireframes we improved and refined the wireframes depending on each member comments
            from the initial individual wireframe.</p>
        <p>For the navigation, the team along with Ata choose to implement my vertical progress navigation. </p>
        <h3 class="w2">Back to Square One (Redesign)</h3>
        <p>With six weeks left, all had hectic schedules with our studies and part-time jobs. To get a move on, I
            decided that as a team we had to get a move along as a construction leader. I also want to redesign the
            wireframe with a different concept which is both user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. </p>
        <p>The current UI trends were using tiles, gradient colours, a lot of white space that emphasised minimalistic
            design.</p>
        <p>Some of the key features which we planned to focus on where the navigation flow, implementation of tools and
            tips widget which allows users to access additional information, breaking down the form into understandable
            bit size features. </p>
        <p style="color: #0F78C3">Concept 1 (chevron progress navigation with the banner on the top):</p>
        <img src="2shakes/mid break design 1.PNG" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px">
        <p>For this concept, I choose to implement the downwards chevron on the left, and tools and tips on the right.
            The primary forms would in the middle taking 75% of the width. Based on current UI trends, I used rounded
            corners and symmetry. </p>
        <p style="color: #0F78C3">Concept 2 (step progress navigation on the top and tiles on the left side):</p>
        <img src="2shakes/mid break design 2.PNG" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>For this concept, I to implement a step progress bar in sideways chevron which has icons. We would break
            down each step into subsection and use tiles on the left. </p>
        <p style="color: #0F78C3">Concept 3 (Dropdown navigation):</p>
        <img src="2shakes/cleanui concept opened.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 1000px"><br>
        <p>Design 3 above was inspired from Google Drive's side navigation that has minimalistic drop-down navigation
            with icons that globally recognised for better recognition and recall. </p>
        <h3>Mid-break team meeting </h3>
        <p>After I had finished designing the quick concept, we as a team met up, to discuss the design and decided to
            create another concept based on the side chevron design Ata the project sponsor liked. </p>
        <img src="2shakes/team concept side tiles.jpg" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>The new design included tiles, which also incorporated chevrons. We decided further to have tabs for the top
            navigation in our team meeting. </p>
        <img src="2shakes/sketches during meeting.jpg" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>The image above denotes sketches we made (in the meeting) of some tile design ideas.</p>
        <img src="2shakes/tiles side and bottom.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>We played around with seeing how the tiles would look at the bottom due to the fact as this is a rising
            trend in web apps, especially on devices such as tablets and mobile phones. Our project sponsors at this
            stage were still debating whether they think having a review page is beneficial to their users.</p>
        <img src="2shakes/sidenav with tabs on the top.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>Instead of using tiles for the secondary navigation we decided to also experiment with tabs on the top.</p>
        <img src="2shakes/on hover side navgation.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>The design above shows that when the user hovers over the tiles, the menu expands and also on the right-hand
            side the tools and tips can be minimised. </p>
        <h3>Meeting With Mike (Sponsor) </h3>
        <p>During the university break, we emailed Mike the project sponsor to have a look at our concepts, and he
            collated all the designs and presented his own version of the UI patterns or wireframes.</p>
        <div class="video-container1" style="text-align: center;">
            <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSbKoiZb7TP6mcOYHn9t5mnF8FkDDhj3gAQaEYcUBOcGLKU6x4HzlRAX3PQsv2dIewnEwgxrarlHYJU/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=2000"
                width="1280" height="749" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
        </div>
        <h3>Step-Progress Bar </h3>
        <img src="2shakes/step progress bar design.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>Again back to the drawing board, I wanted to present something which was contemporary with a new fresh look.
            We decided to implement a step-progress bar on the top with tiles on the left side of the screen. </p>
        <p style="color: #0F78C3">Is JetStar the answer?</p>
        <img src="2shakes/Jetstar.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <img src="2shakes/2shakesredign1.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>The second design was inspired based on the Jetstar web flight booking system. </p>
        <p>Mike, the project sponsor, preferred the second option but said he would like to have a footer as well as a
            visual cue which allows the user to know <span id="toproto"></span>which form is currently active because
            the user has the option to
            go back and revisit forms. </p>

        <h3 class="w">Final Prototype</h3>
        <img src="2shakes/loginpage.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>The Login page has been redesigned with rounded corners and with a more contemporary look. </p>
        <img src="2shakes/reviewsignup.png" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>We developed various UI concepts for the profile sign-up form. The review phases allow the user to verify
            the information which has inputted and allows the user to edit their details if necessary. </p>
        <p>When meeting 2Shakes, they were accepting and happy with the layout and styling changes. We incorporated
            into our design so that when Skip was pressed, a pop-up notification would appear on the page giving users
            an option to skip the other stages of the profile set up and get straight to signing up clients or they
            could resume filling in their profile information. </p>
        <img src="2shakes/the chosen traning colour.PNG" alt="New concept" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
        <p>Original training environment included a salmon coloured background. Instead, we went with a teal colour as
            it is different enough from the blue but does not take away from the 2Shakes orange. This colour was
            recommended by Mike, and it worked out reasonably well.

        <h3 class="w">Reflection</h3>
        <h4>Success Of The Project</h4>
        <P>The success of our project was dependant on being able to meet requirements from the project brief. This
            included the fact that the new UI had to allow stakeholders an easy and efficient transition through the
            sign-up process. Following from this the UI that we produced needed to be different from their original
            design, in terms of being refreshing and engaging to 2shakes clients. Ultimately the success of our overall
            project was determined by our sponsors who would thus be the ones determining the final approval of our
            project.</P>
        <p>We were able to measure our project in terms of being an “easy and efficient” process through usability
            testing we conducted after completion of our UI design. We sent the usability test to a variety of people
            in terms of age, profession, gender etc. It was important that we got feedback from a mix of people as it
            meant our design could be critiqued from different perspectives. The feedback we got was remarkably
            positive in the sense that our project was able to be perceived as quite easy to use, visually appealing
            and overall an effective sign-up process. This was supported by facts such as users being able to locate the
            information we asked for, they found the colours complemented the 2shakes brand and worked well and lastly
            there were many aspects in the design that supported the user throughout the process (e.g. Tools & Tips,
            Sub and Main Navigation bar etc). </p>
        <p>Moreover, we needed to take into account that the 2shakes clients we interviewed and received feedback from,
            didn’t actually locate any significant faults with the current process. Thus this meant that our
            deliverables were more so structured towards satisfying our sponsors. Each week we were able to take into
            account sponsor feedback, develop it and then get it critiqued. This is where the agile methodology came
            into play and meant that we had to act in accordance with their changing needs and requirements. Hence
            getting rapid feedback was crucial in order to build our design. Our sponsors were impressed at our ability
            as a team to progress our design in terms of what they wanted continuously. Towards the later weeks we were
            getting closer and closer to what our sponsors had in mind, regarding the project outcome and evidently, we
            were able to deliver and satisfy our sponsors.</p>
        <h4>Team Success</h4>
        <p>The team being in sync was an essential factor that we tried to sustain during the duration of the project.
            Being successful was an important agenda which we made clear in the beginning, so thankfully that was a good
            starting point for our team to connect. We were successful in many aspects working together as we all
            valued what one another had to offer and although there were problems concerning scheduling or coming to a
            decision, we were able to persevere and overcome this through mutual consensus.</p>
        <p>Our sponsors were happy with the way we worked together and stated that they were both able to spot
            something each of us contributed or offered to the final project. As a team, this was important to hear,
            and we were pleased with how our customers responded, as sponsor approval was a critical factor that aided
            us, in determining then, if our project was a success.</p>
        <p>Overall our team was satisfied with the way things turned out within the limited time we had, and we are
            pleased to have met client satisfaction as this was an enabling factor in acknowledging the status of our
            project to be regarded as successful.</p>

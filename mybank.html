        <p>I wanted to explore python and C# programming languages by creating two almost identical console base
            banking system applications with simple features such as adding a new customer and account, deleting a
            records, modifying details, and allowing bankers to look the records of all customers. this allowed for transferring
            payments from one customer to another, clearing and accepting a cheque. Also, for python, I made a
            real-time currency conversion using APIs. </p>
        <p>The design of the application was designed to allow the user to input a number which corresponds to a
            certain user for example 1 for ‘new customer’, 2 for ‘existing customer’ and 3 for ‘banker’. Depending on
            the selected input, the user would get other options to complete the task as mentioned above. If the user
            was a new user, they are required to input their personal details to create their bank account. </p>
        <p>The reason I choose Python and C# programming languages was due to the popularity of the languages in the IT
            <span id="python"></span>
            industry and this is evident in a recent article related to GitHub usage (they are 3rd and 6th most used
            languages respectively). </p>
        <h1 class="w">Python</h1>
        <li>Overall, python was more natural to learn and was unique as it was different to JAVA or C# due to had no curly
            braces, therefore correctly indenting the code was crucial. </li>
        <li>Python was easier to implement the APIs in JSON format and works better with most data types. </li>
        <li>I learnt that I had to cast numeric values input into int or float when storing or programming mathematical
            operation. For example, 2+1 would be 21 instead of equalling to 3 while using string type. </li>
        <li>One of the challenges in python was trying to access a global variable inside a function. To solve the
            issues, I had to insert ‘global’ before the variable inside the function. </li>
        <li>For my data structure, I used a nested dictionary because it enabled me to set up a data structure like a
            HashMap in Java and therefore it allowed me to store the customer number ID as key and the other
            information for that customer number along aside it. </li>
        <li>I was also able to implement a real time currency conversion calculator from one currency to another by
            accessing a JSON file online. This was possibly my biggest challenge in python as I had to convert
            retrieving the exchange rate and program the operations. </li>
        <!-- <li>One of the programming elements I did compromise in this python version having a type check had implemented
            in my C# version. </li>
        <li>Also, for the currency converter, it would have been ideal to store a list of all the currency code so the
            if the user enters an invalid, they asked to enter a valid currency code to proceed. </li> -->
        <li>Overall, I really enjoyed programming in python and in the future, I would use Python for machine learning
            <span id="cprograming"></span>
            projects and participate in Kaggle competitions.
            <!-- where python is used because it is more powerful when constructing mathematical models and creating algorithms. -->
        </li>
        <h1 class="w">C#</h1>
        <li>After developing the application in Python, I chose to build the application in C# which was similar to
            Java because it is an object-oriented language and Microsoft response to Java.</li>
        <!-- <li>C# has some subtle differences such as the main method, declaring constants, foreach statements, print
            statements for system.out. Print vs. Console.Writeline for C#.</li> -->
        <li>In C# I also wrote multiple classes in a single file, which proved adventurous while creating the custom
            class object for the list because I was able to match the variable better the switching file while
            programming. </li>
        <li>The basic principles for C# were similar to JAVA. Writing and reading from the console was the more
            preferred way for me (rather than having a scanner), but I struggled using a list in C# because of the
            custom class object and writing the setter and getter because it was different to JAVA.</li>
        <span id="summary"></span>
        <li>One extension for python was the exchange rate converter, which I did not implement because of time
            constraints and complexity. </li>
        <h1 class="w">Summary </h1>
        <p>Overall, Python was more straightforward to learn and is instantaneous for development. While in
            C#, the program needs a main method to run the application. Most of my skills in Java were transferable to
            C# because they are both object orientated programming languages. For more extensive and visual application
            - C# would be more preferred, while, for data or mathematical application python would be more suitable.</p>

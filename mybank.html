			Open Project on GitHub (Source Code)</a>
		<p>This Hackathon was an in collaboration with various secondary college around Wellington, Business Analysis,
			UX designer and Software Developer like me. Various professional from corporate organisations such as
			Deloitte, Xero, Datacom and Microsoft as were there as mentors to observe and help teams in projects. </p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">First task: Identifying barriers to learning science. </h3>
		<div style="margin: 0 auto;max-width: 800px; width: 100%;">
			<div class="hoverOverImage">
				<img src="projects/Hackathon/hackathonbrainstrom.jpg" class="hoverOverImage-layer_bottom" id="conner_round" style="width:100%">
				<div class="hoverOverImage-layer_top">
					<div class="hoverOverImage-text">Brainstorm the barriers to learning science.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Brainstorm with college students and other participants.</p>
		</div>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Second task: Develop a project brief for a digital solution to address a science
			barrier. </h3>
		<p>At this stage the participants were asked to choose a topic which we would like to solve and form a team
			with a combination of college students and various participants with different expertise. </p>
		<p>The topic I choose “Information not being provided in an interesting way” because I believed this topic
			would have the most creativity and would be able a quality user experience.</p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Team Formation </h3>
		<p><b>Team Name </b>: Four toed sloth (Named by Ryan, the college student)</p>
		<p><b>Members </b>: Callum & Smeet (Software developers), Ryan Eagles From (Wellington Girls College) and 2
			Business analysists.</p>
		<h1 class="w">Day 1</h1>
		<p>We had two deadlines to work towards which the first deliverable was to present our project concept to a
			couple of the other teams. The second deliverable was to present the final solution, based on the user
			experience, level of innovation and how well we responded to the brief. </p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Challenges of coming up with a project idea.</h3>
		<p><b>Chosen Problem: </b>Information is not being provided in an interesting way for college students.</p>
		<p>We had an enthusiastic from Student Ryan from Wellington Girls College who had a board interest in
			science and mention that their college was governed by may strict rules, which meant they weren’t able
			to carry out science-based experiments to class injuries. </p>
		<p>Coming up with a project concept proved to be quite challenging because topic was quite board.</p>
		<p>Using my systems analysis interviewing and requirements gather knowledge which learnt during my
			undergraduate degree, I was able to successfully able to help the team find the problem. </p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">The 5 Whys?</h3>
		<img src="projects/Hackathon/The5Whys.jpg" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
		<p>I decided to use the ‘5 Whys’ with Ryan to understand the issues more in depth. </p>
		<p>I asked Ryan<B> “why do you think information is not being provided in an interesting way?”</B></p>
		<p>1: Because we are not allowed to carry out particles. </p>
		<p><b>Why? </b>2: Because a girl in my class burnt her hand in the blue flame. We not allowed do anything in
			the lab.</p>
		<p><b>Why? </b>3: Therefore, we learn the theory for books.</p>
		<p><b>Why? </b>4: And No one like to read for 40 minutes.</p>
		<p><b>Why? </b>5: It is boring, and I don’t learn off that.</p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Solution</h3>
		<p>To solve this problem, we decided to create an interest science platform, that allows science students like
			Ryan to learn the theory of interesting videos and having an interesting simulation. </p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Concept Presentation</h3>
		<div class="video-container1" style="text-align: center;">
			<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQZGFTYEo3s6KXXaUW9IOYyNH49WiXOghuMLvAjswsdolC5xwidcg6WPcJRdx9NACMbcw12lojxBJUe/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000"
			 frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
		</div>
		<p>Based on the comments we received from the mentors we realise that we needed to cut down on our scope
			because we don’t have much time and possibly just focus on something simple. We decided to make a basic
			periodic table game. </p>
		<h1 class="w">Day 2</h1>
		<p>For the second day we had to create and present our solution. In the team, I was the only team member who
			has experience in web development. Callum made an accessibility keyboard for people with disabilities and
			gathered resources for the web application such the images and element combination to make the product. The
			two Business analyst was late and came after mid-day. They where tasked to change my original slides from
			day 1 for the final presentation. </p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Smart Science Platform menu</h3>
		<img src="projects/Hackathon/hackathonHome.png" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
		<p>To represent the different topic and modules I created side navigation which student would be able to access
			other science simulations which have been made available by the student's teacher. The teacher would be
			able to track their student progress and parent would also be able to track their child's progress. </p>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Development of the Web App.</h3>
		<p>Because of the shortage of both time and skills. The team had started researching ideals for and game
			implementation the day before. Callum started reaching into any periodic table which we could have used
			from the internet by all had proven to be difficult because the table has a lot of elements, so it was
			difficult to use any. </p>
		<li>To display the periodic table, I created a table with 9 row and 18 columns with buttons inside them. </li>
		<li>I created the periodic table to be responsive for devices such as tables and anything larger. Because of
			the number of elements in the table, it is not ideal to use on a smartphone. </li>
		<img src="projects/Hackathon/table.png" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
		<li>All element buttons display an atomic number and letter symbol. Elements have also been coloured coded
			based on the type of element, such as metals and non-metals. </li>
		<li>On hover of an element the element name would display and when click a discption of the element is
			displayed above the table. </li>
		<h3 style="color: orange">Challenges</h3>
		<li>Devlopeing the game logic to create the formula was the most difficult challenge. I resloved this as I stored the
			current element as variable and compare it with the following element and count the amount of time an element has
			been press consecutively. If the element changes the counter resets the string builds on. I also had to create a
			regex which removes and rewrites the pervious element with added number if element was the same. </li>
		<img src="projects/Hackathon/gamefinished.png" class="cenimg" style="max-width: 800px"><br>
		<li>Another challenge was creating the periodic table because it was a tedious task.  </li>

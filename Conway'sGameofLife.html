        <p>Our task was to, as a group, design an OOP based on Conway’s Game of Life, incorporating the knowledge we
            had gathered in SWEN501 and utilising JavaFX. In summary, this meant we needed to create a GUI that a
            user could interact with and build the functionality around this to enable them to do so.</p>
        <p>Briefly, Conway’s Game of Life works by having an infinite 2D grid of cells, each of which is either ‘alive’
            or ‘dead’. These cells are displayed on the screen, and how they are generated and destroyed over time
            creates various patterns which appear on the screen. The ‘rules’ of the game are as follows:</p>
        <li>If the cell is alive in this generation, and it has two or three alive neighbours (in all eight
            directions), then it should stay alive in the next generation.</li>
        <li>If the cell is dead in this generation, and it has three alive neighbours (in all eight directions), then
            it should become alive in the next generation.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, the cell should be dead in the next generation.</li>

        <h3>Team members:</h3>
        <p>Fiona, Sarah, Caitlin, Carlos and Smeet (Myself)</p>
        <h1 class="w">Code Design</h1>
        <p>Our first step was to individually research the background of Conway’s Game of Life, and making notes about
            features that we felt were important. Following this, we then came back together to share our ideas and
            thoughts. This led to drafting an outline for how we thought the basic structure of our programme should
            look (see Fig.1). </p>

                style="width:100%">
            <div class="hoverOverImage-layer_top">

        </div>
        <p>The above image shows the basic first steps we took together as part of our design process. In the
            beginning, our initial plan was to separate the programme into three classes, which included:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>User Interface</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This was intended to hold the main method, as well as any relevant buttons, sliders, animation
                    requirements, event handlers and initialising the scene being used to display these items.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>World (Rules)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>- This was intended to hold our cells, grid shape, and any methods and/or the ‘rules’ we wrote into
                    our programme.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cells</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our initial thought process was that this class would primarily hold state, location, size, and
                    getters and setters for the ‘alive’ and ‘dead’ cells within our grid.</li>
                <li>We thought this may possibly extend the pre-designed Rectangle class available in Java. </li>
                <li>It is important to note that initially, our thought was that we would store these cells in a 2D
                    array within our project. However, as we looked further into the task and its requirements, we
                    realised that a HashMap would be a better alternative. This was largely due to the requirement of
                    an ‘infinite 2D grid of cells’ within the game, which is very difficult to achieve through the use
                    of an array, as they require a defined number of data entries. A LinkedList or HashMap, on the
                    other hand, would give us the capability to better hold very large - in this case infinite -
                    amounts of data as required in this programme. This is also discussed in further detail later in
                    this report.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>Class and Sequence diagram</h3>
        <div class="hoverOverImage">
            <img src="projects/Conway's Game of Life/fig2cgol.PNG" class="hoverOverImage-layer_bottom" id="conner_round"

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We felt that a Class Diagram was relevant to our project as it really helped us to think about how we needed
            to structure our classes so that they could interact with each other effectively, and would make it much
            easier down the line for those coding to see and understand these relationships. Furthermore, if any
            changes were required later on in the project, we realised that having a detailed and effective Class
            Diagram would undoubtedly help those performing maintenance on the programme to have a clearer idea of its
            intended structure and where any issues may have arisen from. </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Sequence diagrams also proved to be a great resource for being able to demonstrate and understand our
            <span id="implymentation"></span>
            programme. This helped us to understand how ‘flow’ of the processes within our code would work, identify
            and eliminate unnecessary links between our classes, and to see which responsibilities belonged to each of
            our classes and how messages were communicated between these.</p>
        <h1 class="w">Implementation</h1>
        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <p>The implementation of our project went very smoothly as we ensured we were organised and focused on the
            tasks we needed to achieve from the very beginning. Our first sprint, to achieve by the end of the day on
            Monday, was to produce a minimum viable product - version one of the game - with a basic user interface and
            a grid of cells. As mentioned previously, we began this process by individually researching the background
            of Conway’s Game of Life, and made notes about features that we felt were important. We then came back
            together to share our ideas and thoughts as a group, and created an outline of the basic structure of our
            programme.</p>
        <p>After creating the initial design and roughly outlining our Class and Sequence diagrams, we began coding. We
            started with the more basic aspects of the programme, specifically the user interface and key buttons that
            we would need to get our programme to work. We also managed to begin on some of the logic for the
            functionality of the programme on our first day. This created a great base for us to work off leading in to
            day two of the project.</p>
        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <p>From here, it was much easier to anticipate what we could realistically achieve each day, based on the pace
            we had set on Monday. We set ourselves a goal to achieve the creation of ‘alive’ and ‘dead’ cells by
            Tuesday lunchtime, as well as adding functionality to our UI buttons. Our third sprint, completed by
            Tuesday afternoon, was to have the logic of our cell generation completed.</p>
        <p>The primary coding technique we used in these first two days was <b>Mob Programming</b>. At a very high
            level, Mob Programming meant that while only one person would be coding at a time and making commits from
            their computer, each member of the team would be present and working on the project at the same time, from
            this central computer, which we had projected onto a larger television screen. This was a great opportunity
            for our team to collaborate, continuously review our code, develop our communication skills, and for us all
            to be involved in the coding of our programme. It enabled us to make decisions quickly and troubleshoot any
            issues very early on in our process. While a majority of our commits to GitLab come from Fiona’s computer,
            each team member was able to contribute to the code, largely thanks to the use of this technique. </p>
        <div class="hoverOverImage">
            <img src="projects/Conway's Game of Life/cgolTesting.png" class="hoverOverImage-layer_bottom" id="conner_round"
                style="width:100%">
            <div class="hoverOverImage-layer_top">
                <div class="hoverOverImage-text">Commenting out different lines of code to try and identify the problem
                    when drawing a Glider.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>As we went along, we were also very careful to ensure we kept a record of what we had achieved that day, and
            created a draft report and presentation as we went. This ensured not only that our information would be as
            accurate as possible, but also that we were not put under time pressure at the end of the week and could
            instead focus on improving and modifying our code.</p>
        <h2>Day 3</h2>
        <P>The focus of day three of the project - our final sprint - was to further refine our code and eliminate any
            bugs we came across (detailed further in Part Two of this report). We also used this time to further
            develop the content for our presentation and to practise this together as a team, as well as refine our
            drafted diagrams. At this stage in the project, we found that Peer Programming was a very useful tool. The
            use of this technique, which consisted of two to three people working together on a piece of code from one
            laptop, was incredibly helpful as it allowed us to share coding and report writing responsibilities amongst
            the team. This increased our productivity immensely. As with Mob Programming, it again allowed us to
            collaborate and troubleshoot successfully. We were careful to ensure that all team members not working
            directly on the code were aware of and understood what had been completed afterwards.</P>
        <span id="refection"></span>
        <h2>Last Day</h2>
        <p>Our final day was largely spent editing and refining our code, report and presentation together as a group,
            as well as presenting our thus-far-completed programme to the cohort.</p>
        <h1 class="w">Refection </h1>
        <p>We were very happy with the final outcome of our project and feel that we successfully managed to incorporate
            into each of the key aspects of Conway’s original Game of Life, as well as add additional features and
            aesthetics to enhance our users’ experience. </p>
        <p>Our team functioned and collaborated very well as a group, providing support and assistance to each other
            when needed. We all felt very motivated to achieve a great end result, which we believe is clear in the way
            everybody got involved and took responsibility for their part of the project, as well as in our final
            output. </p>
        <p>This project proved to be a great opportunity for us to learn about each other’s strengths and weaknesses,
            to familiarise ourselves with various programming techniques, tools, and design and documentation
            processes, as well as to work on our communication and teamwork skills, all of which will undoubtedly prove
            invaluable in the future.</p>

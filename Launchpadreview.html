            by <b>Martin Albisetti</b>
        </h2>

        <!-- review of the artical -->
        <p>The integration of agile development for UX design has been a popular topic for software development for the
            last decade due to the profound implications and success of agile development in the IT industry. The role
            of the UX designer has often been overlooked in agile development projects because of the standard
            practices or perceptions (da Silva T.S., 2013, p. 4) that the UX team should stay ahead and have the
            patterns ready for developers. In this critical review, I will be reviewing an academic journal
            ‘Launchpad's Quest for A Better and Agile User Interface’ by Martin Albisetti who worked with an amazing
            Launchpad team at Canonical. Martin addresses his experience of 'shifting the Launchpads teams focus to a
            more user-friendly mindset' by implementing the agile methodology with changes to their processes ensuring
            <span id="review"></span> were able to deliver iterative improvements from a usability perspective (Albisetti, 2010, p. 1).
            Martin emphasises that they went from nobody owing the user interface to the developer feeling a strong
            ownership over the UX (Albisetti, 2010, p. 1).</p>
        <h2 class="w">Review</h2>
        <h3>Launchpad Platform and Canonical Overview</h3>
        <p>Launchpad is now a software open source collaboration platform which allows users to develop and maintain,
            find bugs in a software (Canonical Ltd, 2018). The software is written in python and JavaScript developed
            by Canonical Ltd (Albisetti, 2010, p. 2) which was established alongside Ubuntu to help it reach a broader
            market (Canonica Ltd, 2018). Canonical's mission is to make “open source software available to people
            everywhere” (Canonical Ltd, 2018) and Martin praises Mark Shuttleworth for making the bold move of making
            the code open source as it now allows users to fix bugs to improve the experience of thousands of people
            (Albisetti, 2010). </p>
        <h3>The End Goal </h3>
        <p>The team a Launchpad were tasked with an ‘ambitious goal of building a new user interface’ for Launchpad
            (Albisetti, 2010, p. 1), which meant introducing change to the established teams and existing code. The
            article highlights the importance of mentoring their developer, so it enables them to see work from a UX
            perspective while developing with a user-friendly mindset (Albisetti, 2010, p. 1). This led the developer
            to believe that they have strong ownership over the UX because of the changes of the process such as the
            pre-implementation meetings and mentoring changed their perceptive of the developers had the necessary
            knowledge to deliver quality UI and carry out UX reviews, so they didn’t have rely totally on Martin as his
            vacation was fast approaching (Albisetti, 2010, pp. 5, 7). </p>
        <h3>Martins Role </h3>
        <p>Martin Albisetti oversaw the user interface for the Launchpad team and ensured that the web pages were ‘easy
            to use and slick’ (Revell, 2009). Before working at Canonical, he was at Pentacorp for about six years
            (Revell, 2009), and now Martin was part of the board for the Launchpad project (Revell, 2009). As a member
            of the board, this enabled Martin to implement the big changes to the Launchpad strategies and drive the UX
            value throughout their process (Albisetti, 2010, pp. 5, 7). In the Launchpad Blog, Martin explicitly stated
            he didn’t do much coding but instead had made improvements for the home and other pages, so some of the
            pages would inevitably go through him during the reviews (Revell, 2009). Later in this review, you will
            read about Martins role for the Launchpad project which drove the change. Prior to reading this paper, I
            was looking forward to learning about how UX is implemented from an agile development perspective. However,
            the paper failed to discuss the topic. This paper is somewhat in my opinion outdated according to the
            current agile practices as many organisations have their individual UX teams and various other teams, but
            this paper rather communicates the changes the process to bring UX to the software development process. </p>
        <h3>The Lack of UX for Launchpad </h3>
        <p>The standpoint of this article highlights the friction between the Martin and the developer creating a new
            UI for launchpad, which has been four years in the making so far and they have little over a year to go
            (Albisetti, 2010, p. 1). The developers have been producing polished code that has been further tested and
            reviewed ensuring that high quality of software for the user (Albisetti, 2010, p. 1). The same could not be
            said for the user experience because the UI review had not been introduced at this stage. In the article,
            Martin mentions that ‘fundamental features that had been developed were going unused’ (Albisetti, 2010, pp.
            1,2) and this defeated the purpose of the project. Last year, I was responsible for redesigning the UX for
            a Govt-tech organisation 2Shakes in a team, and the web application had violated all of Jacob Neilson
            usability heuristics simply because the signup form was too complicated with several features which most of
            2Shakes customer were unaware of during the usability testing which we carried out. For launchpad, the
            usability heuristics “match between system and the real world” appear to have been breached because of the
            possibility of using system-oriented terms rather than the phrases and concepts (Nielsen, 1995) which are
            familiar to the majority of the user. Martin states that they had made the UI consistent across the board
            and streamlined work-flows and develop predictable interactions indicating that navigation of the software
            had been poorly designed. Many of the developers were not using even using the features developed, and this
            had to change by making it more accessible and user friendly as stressed by Martin (Albisetti, 2010, p. 1).
        </p>
        <h3>Developer Carrying Out UX Reviews</h3>
        <p>One of the main challenges was coordinating and communicating with various teams which consisted of 34
            people span across the nine different time-zones (Albisetti, 2010, p. 2). The members working on the
            Launchpad project was a strong believer in the agile process, but often the developer could not justify
            spending extra days working on a feature to make the UI consistent (Albisetti, 2010, p. 2). Prior to the
            process changes, there was a strong emphasis on functionality rather than the usability of Launchpad and
            nobody seems to own the UI (Albisetti, 2010, p. 2). The introduction of UX reviews was undoubtedly a game
            changer for Canonical in my opinion as this mirrored the existing code review process but was not made
            mandatory initially. Again, this was an issue because the developer did not tend to like revisiting the
            code and change it if it has been well tested (Albisetti, 2010, p. 2). As most of the process was being
            mirrored from the programming side, it was curial that code reviewer was not the same person as the UX
            reviewer because the conflicting interest and they understand the struggles of the programmer and would
            make it harder for implementing change (Albisetti, 2010, p. 4). </p>
        <h3>UX Team</h3>
        <p>It was time for the UX team to take more reasonability and establish proper UX practices. Martin and his
            team began to work on the UI plans and talk to their existing users to understand their frustrations and
            identify elements to change which would impact the greatest number of users (Albisetti, 2010, p. 3). Martin
            also started using the application more to get a better sense to understand the user's perspective
            (Albisetti, 2010, p. 3) and that that they started presenting short videos to illustrated to communicate
            their revised designs to the developing teams (Albisetti, 2010, p. 3). The team at Launchpad had also
            developed the technical implementation plan, and the development was at a faster pace which means that UI
            reviews had to be made as a gate-keeping too (Albisetti, 2010, p. 3) . Hence the UI review procedure was
            made mandatory (Albisetti, 2010, p. 3). Martins tasks were now to provide recommendation and work with the
            developers till they both satisfied (Albisetti, 2010, p. 3). </p>
        <h3>My opinion of UX and Agile</h3>
        <p>In the last decade, a lot has changed in terms of software development team structure and process. In the
            article, the reader gets the perception that Martin is the sole UX leader, hence the UX process is too
            reliant on him. During my UX industry project with 2Shakes, we had better control over our sprints as we
            had more autonomy and management authority to drive the UX and communicate with 2Shakes software developer.
            The agile methodology has a focus on developers, hence agile is not easy for UX (Laubheimer, 2017). For UX
            to work, I believe that the management needs to value UX and there needs to be a close bond between the UX
            and developers during sprints to validate ideas, conduct UX review and to give constructive feedback. By
            working together, the UX team can gain the trust of the developers and consequently, the UX goals will
            flourish. Based on the Nielsen Group article on agile for UX the author mentions that the Agile process
            works well when the process isn’t completely policed and strict (Laubheimer, 2017). The agile process needs
            to be flexible and allows teams to manage tasks better and user stories so that the UX teams would be able
            to get ahead of the development team (Laubheimer, 2017). Better management would enable the UX team to
            research and thoughtful design solutions (Laubheimer, 2017). The article also suggests the UX people show
            leadership in term of reaching out to the developer to explain the UX process and principles and how would
            produce a better product or UI (Laubheimer, 2017). </p>
        <h3>UX Influences on Developer and Outcomes </h3>
        <p>In the journal, Martins task of delivering new and improved UX was not over without any challenges. Martin
            believes sometimes he was the bottleneck which was hindering the process (Albisetti, 2010, p. 6). To
            counteract the review phase frustration, they introduced pre-implementation meeting that meant, the
            developers at Launchpad would have to email or call Martin to discuss the UX elements that are to be
            developed to address how they look and behave (Albisetti, 2010, p. 4). During the pre-implementation, this
            was where the developer and UX designer could build specification of the UI and hence they are able to
            create beyond the initial concepts or idea (Albisetti, 2010, p. 5). Some of the developers had taken a
            special interest in UI patterns which meant that some of the issues missed by the Martin in the UX reviews
            were actually being pointed out by the developers (Albisetti, 2010, p. 5). Initially, Martin had chosen 3
            developers which future mentored and experimented with them carrying out UX reviews. This enabled them to
            gain so much experience with the UI reviews that was more effective (Albisetti, 2010, p. 5). Martin has
            also brought along few developers would be good at delivering the UI, and after a couple of reviews, these
            developers were also producing polished UX because after the UI review it completely changed the way he saw
            his work (Albisetti, 2010, p. 5). The author also suggests that he regrets documenting the good patterns
            across the application while they came across the reviews because this would have reduced the time he is
            documenting the existing patterns (Albisetti, 2010, p. 7). </p>
        <h3>One-size fits all?</h3>
        <p>The size of organisations and can vary from small start-up to a global company across the world with various
            factors such as the number of teams or team dynamics, the number of backlogs tackle during a sprint,
            technologies and so on. What many people would consider agile to be the life saviour methodology, does not
            always work because of the complexities of the team and iterative project delivery style. Agile should be
            adapted for cases by cases bases and this why it is crucial to have scrum master if scrum is being
            implemented. For launchpad, it appears that it had relatively small UX team which the developer which are
            highly dependent on software development to influence change. In the article by John Yorke, he
            differentiates between a different number of teams and number of backlogs for origination and suggested
            problems can be solved by the organisation rather than adding a layer of over heads and bureaucracy (Yorke,
            2018). Agile for UX designer would not be one-size fits all because again it is totally based on each case
            and depend on many processes and which backlog stories the development teams choose on developing. For the
            <span id="eva"></span> team to also participate in the stand-up meeting would be adventurous, and this would allow them to have
            more of managerial role as well. Therefore, better communication across the teams and they can share the
            feedback from the users. </p>

        <h2 class="w">Reflection and Recommendation </h2>
        <p>Focusing on the agile manifesto there was a working UI over compressive documentation, but Martin stated it
            would have been more efficient if he had documented at the good patterns, the influence of UX embedded
            throughout development meant more user collaboration, testing and the whole purpose of the task was to
            embrace change in an iterative manner (Sloan, 2016). Therefore, I believe that teams at Canonical did
            follow the agile methodology of development, but interaction and communication could have improved if they
            had Skype meetings and face to face interactions. I understand that in a decade a lot has changed and
            possibly it would have been difficult to recommend anything different back then as of the technology and
            how organisation structure their teams. If this project was to happen again, I would recommend that that
            all or most of the teams are within close proximity, and the organisation to have their in-house UX team to
            interact with the users and carry out research, develop personas, backlogs, user stories, wireframes,
            prototypes, carry out A/B testing on the UI and working along the side of the development team during the
            sprints. I believe this would better reflect present day agile development.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Overall, this academic journal by Martin Albisetti discusses the success story at Canonical Ltd delivering
            change for the Launchpad project which consisted of teams who were tasked with an ‘ambitious goal of
            building a new user interface’ for the Launchpad. Despite the problem around the processes and team
            structure Martin was able to introduce UX review and mirror many of the processes which Canonical had for
            the development side. The unique point of difference was that he was able to mentor some of his interested
            developers to perform to the UX review which enables them to have more confidence better UI and have
            <span id="ref"></span>ownership over the UX. Throughout the process, the author influence and drove UX into the development
            process in a manner which allowed to fit in well the existing agile software development.</p>
